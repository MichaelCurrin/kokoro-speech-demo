## Reasons to use Kokoro

- Use your own application to generate quality text to speech output.
- No cost and a better security and privacy, compared with using a paid API.
- Available as Python or Node backend but through HuggingFace's API or as JS on your frontend.
- Works great with content generated by an LLM such as Ollama.
